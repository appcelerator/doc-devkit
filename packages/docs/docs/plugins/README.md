# Plugins

The Titanium Docs DevKit provides a couple of plugins that add new features to VuePress and improve it for usage in technical documentations.

- [Versioning Plugin](./versioning-plugin.md): Adds versioning features to VuePress. Snapshot the current state of your docs to easily access older revisions at a later time. The [Titanium Theme](../theme/README.md) has full support for the versioning plugin and allows you to switch between the different versions of your site.
- [API Docs Plugin](./apidocs-plugin.md): Easily add API docs to a markdown file. These usually are too complex to write directly in markdown, which is where this plugin steps in.
- [FontAwesome Plugin](./fontawesome-plugin.md): Use FontAwesome icons in VuePress. Fully featured with Markdown shorthand and tree-shaking support.
